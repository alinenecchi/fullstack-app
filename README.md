# Project Overview

## Overview

This project is a full-stack application designed to manage and interact with product data. It features a front-end application that communicates with a back-end service. Modern technologies are utilized to ensure robust performance, scalability, and maintainability.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **[Backend](./backend/README.md)**: Manages the server-side logic, data processing, and API endpoints.
2. **Frontend**: Handles the client-side interface, user interactions, and presentation.

Each part has its own set of technologies and configurations. The following sections provide details about the technologies and setup for each part.
